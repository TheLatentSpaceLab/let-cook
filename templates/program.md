## Goal

<!-- What is the end result? Be specific about what "done" looks like. -->

## Context

<!-- Background the producer needs: links, references, prior art, constraints. -->

## Success Criteria

<!-- The evaluator scores each iteration against these. Mark each as (hard) or (soft). -->
<!-- Hard: must pass or the iteration fails. Soft: improves the score but not required. -->

- [ ] (hard) ...
- [ ] (hard) ...
- [ ] (soft) ...
- [ ] (soft) ...

## Notes

<!-- Optional hints, preferences, or things the producer should know. -->
